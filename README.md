## Introduction

At a time when technology is at the pinnacle and is being used to make our lives easier
and more convenient, it may be extraordinary to use the technology to sell Sri Lankan
handicrafts in a matter of minutes. Our goal in creating this "HandyCraft.LK" mobile
application is to offer high-quality goods to clients. Self - employed individuals will be
able to grow their small enterprises globally thanks to this application. Due to its success
on the international market, it will indirectly aid the current economic crisis by bringing
funds into the country. This app provides the customers with many important functions
including ordering handicrafts, add, delete, update, and view products. The app contains
an admin UI as well, where the admin approves products, view, delete history, add
product categories that offers and makes modifications when necessary. Customers and
sellers who have already registered, can login be using valid user credentials. And who
are not yet registered can create a new user account and login. Registered sellers can
add, delete, update products, and estimate total sales. Once logged in, registered users
can browse the product catalog, add items to cart, and confirm orders. Orders are
processed through the system right away.
